This image processing project aims to enhance drone positioning during aerial maneuvers using national flags as visual markers. The code utilizes ArUco markers resembling QR codes on the ground, allowing drones to adjust tilt and height for optimal positioning. The goal is to generate reference images for drone inputs, optimizing their orientation based on the distinct features of the national flag. The project addresses the specific requirements of military drones using the Indian flag as a localizer, showcasing effective image processing techniques for precise and efficient drone navigation.
