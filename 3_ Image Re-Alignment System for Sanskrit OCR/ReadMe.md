#  Image Re-Alignment System for Sanskrit OCR: A Python Program for Horizontal Viewing Optimization
Tapping into the richness of ancient Sanskrit literature, this Python program addresses a common challenge in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) - misalignment. When scanning Sanskrit texts, misalignments can hinder accurate OCR results. This tool automatically realigns scanned images, ensuring that the digitization process is seamless. With a focus on preserving text integrity, the program utilizes image processing algorithms to horizontally optimize the viewing orientation.
