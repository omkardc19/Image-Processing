# Delusion Detector: Image Analysis for Identifying Real vs. Manipulated Representations of Ravana using Python and OpenCV
"Delusion Detector" is a Python program leveraging OpenCV and image analysis techniques to determine the authenticity of representations of the ten-headed demon king Ravana in images related to the festival of Dussehra. The code employs grayscale conversion, thresholding, and peak detection to identify manipulated representations. The program scrutinizes the positioning of heads in the image, assessing their distribution and making a verdict of 'real' or 'fake.' The solution is designed to address the challenge of discerning deceptive qualities, much like the virtuous king Rama overcoming delusions during the epic war.
