# Cross Bilateral Filter for Flash and No-Flash Photography Enhancement using Python and OpenCV
Cross Bilateral Filter for Flash and No-Flash Photography Enhancement leverages Python and OpenCV to tackle the age-old dilemma faced by photographers during pro-night events. In scenarios where both flash and no-flash images are captured, the program skillfully fuses them, eliminating flashy artifacts while preserving image quality. The bilateral filter's ingenious extension ensures the final 'prolight' image is both visually appealing and computationally efficient. The solution excels in producing high-quality results within a short processing time, with speed being a primary evaluation criterion.
